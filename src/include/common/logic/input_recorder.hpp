     *     and object checksum data.
     *   - the inputs; each input is marked by the FINP keyword. We mark the inputs
     *     because, in the case of an unexpected crash, we can use this file for
     *     debugging; the file will be incomplete, but we can find the input commands
     *     thanks to those keywords.
     *   - the footer, marked by the FEND keyword, contains 4 bytes of keyword, 4 bytes of 
     *     input data count and 4 bytes of checksum
     *
     * We do not store the size of the whole file, because this is more like of a streaming
     * format; it is made to be recoverable and readable even if it is a little bit corrupted, 
     * because of a crash.
